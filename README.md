# Elytra
A fork of Pufferfish optimized for better performance (unstable and shouldn't be used in a production environment).
 
 # ***Building***
 To build Elytra from source, run: ```./gradlew applyPatches```
 
 When it completes, run ```./gradlew createReobfPaperclipJar```
 
 The paperclip jar will be in *build\libs* and will be called elytra-paperclip-*.jar
